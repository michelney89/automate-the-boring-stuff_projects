# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Practice Projects
Propositions of solutions for the coding projects in the book [*Automate_the_Boring_Stuff_with_Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) from Al Sweigart.

I will try to add solutions as I'm going through the book.

Thanks to the author Al Sweigart for the nice practice projects !
